## Welcome to CodeLab

Hi there. Welcome to CodeLab. This is Shane, writing from various times in the past (and occasionally Zoe, writing generally from even longer ago). I'm a younger, slightly less experienced, probably slightly more handsome version of Shane from right now, so you'll have to excuse me if I'm unclear or rambly or factually wrong. Don't blame it on Shane Prime. I'm sure he knows better by now. The two of us (Shane and Zoe) and the Scholars' Lab staff created Code Lab back in 2018 as a way to ensure that that year's Praxis cohort would have a good technical foundation on which to build their DH projects and later humanities careers and I've been doing it ever since. Hopefully, you'll be getting all this from a presentation that current-timeline-me has given, is giving, or will shortly give.

This first week is mostly going to be a lot of setting up your computer so you can hit the ground coding next week. We'll also be acclimating to the Command Line Interface (CLI).

## CodeLab Resources
* [Environment Setup Instructions](environment_setup.md)

## Homework for Week 1

  * For Windows users, skip the "Windows Only: Installing Git Bash" section - we're going a different direction. Use the VSCode Terminal or Windows Terminal, as recommended in the Code Lab environment setup.
* [Set up your computer environment](environment_setup.md). Try to follow the instructions, but don't get stuck.
* Set up an account at [Github](http://www.github.com) and post your username on the Slack praxis channel.

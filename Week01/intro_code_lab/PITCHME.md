### Why code?
- Coding is only a part of what digital humanists do. Most DH practioners don't do any.

### Why code?
- "Hack" vs "Yack" or: how is DH work done?
- "Collaboration" vs Collaboration |
- What is Yack (in a DH context) without Hack? |
- If you can't build it, you don't really understand it. |

## Homework

### Assignment 0:

Implement a sorting algorithm for a list of numbers. Don't use any built-in sort. It can be as simple or complicated as you want. Feel free to look at the innumerable other examples on the Internet, but be prepared to explain your code!

```python
def sort_numbers(numbers):
    # your code here
    return sorted_list

numbers = [6,3,7,8,1,3]
print(sort_numbers(numbers))
```

### Assignment 1

[Download the plain text of Much Ado About Nothing from Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1519)

Write a program to read in this file and count the total lines of dialog and the length (character count) of those lines for the two main characters: Benedick and Beatrice. Write that data out to a second file.

*100x Codelab Bonus Points*

Do the same analysis, but for every character that has dialog.
